    <p>A recursive function is a function that call itself during its execution.Recursive function
        are commonly used in programming when a problem can be broken down into smaller, identical sub-problems
        Each recursive calls a smaller instance of the problem until the base case is reached, at which point
        the function stops calling itself and returns a result
